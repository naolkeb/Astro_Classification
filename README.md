# SDSS Classification

In this project, the distribution of galaxies in the SDSS data is explored. SDSS is a large dataset of galaxies with spectroscopic information from the SDSS survey. This survey obtained images for 357,000,000 stars and galaxies in five photometric bands, as well as spectroscopy for 1,600,000 galaxies, quasars, and stars. AstroML provides access to a subset of this huge information.

Three classification methods are discussed to identify their differences in interpretability and viability.
